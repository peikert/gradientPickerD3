# gradientPickerD3
Widget for an interactive selection and modification of a color gradient. gradientPickerD3 allows addition, removment and replacement of color ticks. List of numeric values will automatically translate in their corresponding tick position within the numeric range. App returns a R data.frame containing tick values, colors and the positions in percent (0.0 to 1.0) for each color tick in the gradient. The original JS 'jquery-gradient-picker' was implemented by Matt Crinklaw-Vogt (nick: tantaman)https://github.com/tantaman/. Widget and JS modifications were done by CD. Peikert.
