\description{
Creates a widget for an interactive selection and modification of a color gradient.
'gradientPickerD3' allows the addition, removement and replacement of color ticks.
List of numeric values will automatically translate in its corresponding tick position within the numeric range.
App returns a data.frame containing tick values, colors and the positions in percent (0.0 to 1.0) for each color tick in the gradient.
The original JS 'jquery-gradient-picker' was implemented by Matt Crinklaw-Vogt.
Widget and JS modifications were done by CD. Peikert.
